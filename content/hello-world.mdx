**What Are Open Loops?**

An open loop is **any task or decision you haven’t completed or fully closed**.  
Over time, 
This becomes an invisible weight that many of us carry.

These unspoken, unresolved commitments are called **open loops** —  
and they drain more of your energy than you realize.

It can be anything, like:

- Writing that resume you’ve been postponing  
- Applying for internships and jobs  
- Having a tough conversation you’ve been avoiding  
- Starting a project you keep putting off  
- Ignoring your academic obligations  

Individually, they seem small.  
But together, they create **mental clutter**.

## **The Psychology Behind Open Loops: The Zeigarnik Effect**

In the early 1900s, psychologist **Bluma Zeigarnik** discovered something fascinating:

> **Your brain remembers incomplete tasks more than completed ones.**

This constant mental reminder creates tension, pulling your focus and stealing your energy —  
even when you’re not consciously thinking about it.

That’s why unfinished tasks feel heavy.  
Your brain keeps them “open,” consuming background processing power like apps running on your phone.

## **Avoidance Makes It Worse**

Modern research shows something counterintuitive. When given a choice between:

- **A strong discomfort now**, or  
- **A mild discomfort later**  

Most people choose the **strong discomfort now**.

Why?

Because **uncertainty and avoidance** create more anxiety than facing discomfort directly.

Avoiding a loop doesn’t make it disappear —  
it stretches your stress across **days or even weeks**.

## **Why Closing Loops Gives You Instant Energy**

When you close a loop — clearing that backlog exam, applying to internships (even if they don’t reply), sending that message — you experience an **immediate release** of mental tension.

Your mind relaxes.  
You feel lighter, clearer, and more focused.

Closing one loop leads to another.  
Momentum builds.  
Confidence grows.

It’s the simplest productivity hack that feels like **magic**.
